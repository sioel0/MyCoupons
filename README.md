# MyCoupons
Android app for mobile development course.
This is my first Android app developed during Mobile Development course of my Bachelor Degree.

## Overview
This app is a very simple coupon storage application, it gives the user the opportunity add coupons by adding it manually or scanning it.
The application itself keep track of expired coupons that user can delete. It displays all the coupons both as QR code and bar code.
